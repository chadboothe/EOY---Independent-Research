# EOY---Independent-Research

On a daily basis upload whatever resources you have completed for your End of Year Project. What you upload on a daily basis is how I will grade you on a weekly basis. Here are some examples of things you could be uploading:

* Performed Research: Then write a paragraph or more with what you learned, to include the link(s) to where you found your research information.
* Wrote Code: Upload the code you wrote.
* Took Notes: Upload the notes you took.
* Worked on a circuit board: Take pictures of what progress you made.
* etc...
